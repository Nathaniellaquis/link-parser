# Platform Parser Update Template - Complete Guide

## Goal
Update each platform parser to:
1. Support ALL listed domains (not just the primary one)
2. Accept query parameters (`?utm_source=...`) and fragments (`#section`)
3. Support all subdomains (www, mobile, open, api, etc.) - UNIVERSAL approach
4. **NEVER hardcode domains in patterns** - always use `createDomainPattern`

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Add Required Imports at the Top
Add these two imports after the existing imports:
```typescript
import { createDomainPattern } from '../../utils/url'
import { QUERY_HASH } from '../../utils/constants'
```

### Step 2: Extract Domain Configuration
Look for the existing `domains` and `subdomains` arrays in the platform module.
Create constants BEFORE the export statement:

```typescript
// Define the config values first (copy from existing arrays)
const domains = ['domain1.com', 'domain2.com']  // Copy exact values from domains array below

// Only add this if subdomains exists in the platform config
const subdomains = ['m', 'mobile', 'open', 'api']  // Copy exact values from subdomains array below

// Create the domain pattern using the config values
// If no subdomains, use: createDomainPattern(domains)
// If has subdomains, use: createDomainPattern(domains, subdomains)
const DOMAIN_PATTERN = createDomainPattern(domains, subdomains)
```

### Step 3: Update the Platform Module Export
Replace the hardcoded arrays with the constants:

```typescript
export const platformName: PlatformModule = {
  // ... keep all other properties as they are ...
  
  domains: domains,  // Replace the array with the constant
  subdomains: subdomains,  // Only if it exists (was mobileSubdomains)
  
  patterns: {
    // Patterns will be updated in Step 4
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Update Each Pattern

**CRITICAL**: 
- You MUST use `new RegExp()` constructor because we're using template strings with variables
- **NEVER hardcode domains** - always use `${DOMAIN_PATTERN}`

For each pattern in the `patterns` object:

#### 4.1 Simple Profile Pattern
```typescript
// BEFORE (example):
profile: /^https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?platform\.com\/([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\/?$/i

// AFTER:
profile: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
```

#### 4.2 Content Pattern with ID
```typescript
// BEFORE (example):
video: /^https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?platform\.com\/watch\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$/i

// AFTER:
video: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/watch/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
```

#### 4.3 Pattern with Optional Path Parts
If the original pattern has `(?:\/.*)?` or similar optional parts, KEEP THEM:

```typescript
// BEFORE (example):
post: /^https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?platform\.com\/p\/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)(?:\/.*)?$/i

// AFTER (keep the (?:/.*)? BEFORE the QUERY_HASH):
post: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/p/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)(?:/.*)?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
```

### Step 5: Pattern Conversion Rules

When converting each pattern:

1. **Replace domain pattern**: 
   - FROM: `(?:www\.)?platform\.com` or `(?:www\.)?(?:platform\.com|alt\.com)`
   - TO: `${DOMAIN_PATTERN}` (ALWAYS)

2. **Add query/hash support**:
   - Add `${QUERY_HASH}` at the very END of the pattern
   - This goes AFTER any optional path parts like `(?:/.*)?`

3. **Keep everything else the same**:
   - Don't change capture groups `([...])`
   - Don't change path segments `/watch/`, `/p/`, etc.
   - Keep any special regex like `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`

4. **Handle trailing slash**:
   - If pattern ends with `\/?`, replace with `/?${QUERY_HASH}`
   - If pattern ends with `$`, replace with `/?${QUERY_HASH}$`
   - Always make trailing slash optional with `/?`

5. **Use RegExp constructor**:
   - MUST use: `new RegExp(\`pattern\`, 'i')`
   - Cannot use: `/pattern/i` (literal syntax doesn't work with template strings)

### Step 6: Special Cases to Watch For

#### Multiple Domains in Original Pattern
```typescript
// BEFORE:
channel: /^https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?(?:youtube\.com|youtu\.be)\/c\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$/i

// AFTER (DOMAIN_PATTERN already handles all domains):
channel: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/c/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
```

#### Subdomain-Specific Patterns (like Spotify's open.spotify.com)
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - hardcoded):
track: /^https?:\/\/open\.spotify\.com\/track\/([A-Za-z0-9]{20,22})$/i

// AFTER (CORRECT - use subdomain in createDomainPattern):
const domains = ['spotify.com']
const subdomains = ['open']  // This handles open.spotify.com
const DOMAIN_PATTERN = createDomainPattern(domains, subdomains)

track: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/track/([A-Za-z0-9]{20,22})/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
```

#### Handle Pattern (no URL, just validation)
```typescript
// Leave handle patterns unchanged - they don't match URLs:
handle: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_](?:[a-zA-Z0-9_.]*[a-zA-Z0-9_])?$/i  // NO CHANGE
```

### Complete Example: Spotify (Fixed)

```typescript
import { PlatformModule, Platforms, ParsedUrl } from '../../core/types'
import { normalize } from '../../utils/url'
import { createDomainPattern } from '../../utils/url'
import { QUERY_HASH } from '../../utils/constants'

// Define the config values first
const domains = ['spotify.com']  // NOT ['spotify.com', 'open.spotify.com'] ❌
const subdomains = ['open']      // Handle open.spotify.com as subdomain ✅

// Create the domain pattern using the config values
const DOMAIN_PATTERN = createDomainPattern(domains, subdomains)

export const spotify: PlatformModule = {
  id: Platforms.Spotify,
  name: 'Spotify',
  color: '#1DB954',

  domains: domains,
  subdomains: subdomains,

  patterns: {
    track: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/track/([A-Za-z0-9]{20,22})/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i'),
    // ... other patterns using DOMAIN_PATTERN
  },

  // ... rest of the module unchanged ...
}
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **DON'T hardcode domains in patterns**:
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded domain:
   track: new RegExp(`^https?://open\\.spotify\\.com/track/([A-Za-z0-9]+)/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - Use domain pattern:
   track: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/track/([A-Za-z0-9]+)/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
   ```

2. **DON'T use literal regex syntax with template strings**:
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG - This won't work:
   profile: /^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/username/?$/i
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - Use RegExp constructor:
   profile: new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/username/?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
   ```

3. **DON'T forget the backticks in RegExp**:
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG - Regular quotes won't interpolate variables:
   new RegExp('^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/...')
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - Use backticks for template strings:
   new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/...`)
   ```

4. **DON'T change non-URL patterns**:
   ```typescript
   // Handle patterns validate usernames, not URLs - leave them as-is:
   handle: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/i  // NO CHANGE NEEDED
   ```

5. **DON'T put QUERY_HASH in the middle**:
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG:
   new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/p/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)${QUERY_HASH}(?:/.*)?$`, 'i')
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - QUERY_HASH goes at the end:
   new RegExp(`^https?://${DOMAIN_PATTERN}/p/([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)(?:/.*)?${QUERY_HASH}$`, 'i')
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

After updating a platform, test it with:
1. Primary domain + query: `platform.com/user?utm_source=test`
2. Secondary domains: `short.domain/user`  
3. Subdomains: `m.platform.com/user`, `open.platform.com/content`
4. With fragments: `platform.com/content#section`
5. Original working URLs should still work
